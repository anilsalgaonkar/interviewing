The power of the sliding window algorithm is to prevent unnecessary iterations over a collection. 
When you are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists), 
it is the hint for using sliding window technique. In some problems, 
the size of the sliding window is not fixed (such as sample question 2), 
and you have to expand or shrink the window based on the problem constraints.
